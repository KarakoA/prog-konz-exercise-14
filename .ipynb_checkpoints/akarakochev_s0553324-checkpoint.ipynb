Bear in mind, that both $\\theta$ and $z$ are probability distributions, a one dimensional vector of real values summing to one. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters of the Dirichlet distribution, that set the prior of the per topic document and word distributions respectively. $\\alpha$ control how likely it is that a document contains most topics and $\\beta$ that a topic contains most words. The higher the respective values, the more likely.\n",
